- ✅ Added basic test structure and README documentation
- ✅ Established proper macOS app architecture foundation

**Key Files Created:**
- `Sources/Magnify/App/main.swift` - App entry point
- `Sources/Magnify/App/AppDelegate.swift` - Main app delegate with permission handling
- `Sources/Magnify/Resources/Info.plist` - Bundle configuration
- `Sources/Magnify/Resources/Magnify.entitlements` - Security permissions
- `Package.swift` - Swift Package Manager configuration
- `Tests/MagnifyTests.swift` - Basic test structure

#### Checkpoint 1.2: ScreenCaptureKit Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created ScreenCaptureManager class with async/await functionality
- ✅ Implemented display enumeration and selection
- ✅ Added basic screen capture functionality using ScreenCaptureKit
- ✅ Created comprehensive permission flow with user guidance
- ✅ Built extensive unit test suite (ScreenCaptureManagerTests.swift)
- ✅ Achieved <100ms screen capture performance requirement

### 🚧 Current Checkpoint

#### Checkpoint 1.3: Transparent Overlay Window System (IN_PROGRESS)
**Objectives:**
- Create transparent overlay NSWindow for system-wide annotations
- Implement borderless, transparent window with proper level management
- Set up window to display on all Spaces and remain on top
- Add basic mouse event handling for overlay interaction
- Test overlay window behavior across different scenarios

**Next Steps:**
1. Create OverlayWindow class extending NSWindow
2. Implement OverlayContentView for drawing surface
3. Configure window properties (transparent, borderless, top-level)
4. Add cross-Space display functionality
5. Test mouse event handling and window management

## Embedded Rules

### RULE_CHECKPOINT_01: Project Foundation
- All basic project files must be created and properly configured
- Bundle ID, entitlements, and Info.plist must be App Store ready
- Code must follow Swift and AppKit best practices
- Project structure must support future feature additions

### RULE_CHECKPOINT_02: Screen Capture Core
- Must use ScreenCaptureKit for macOS 12.3+ compatibility
- Proper permission handling and user guidance required
- Display detection and selection functionality needed
- Error handling for permission denied scenarios

## Active Plan

**Current Focus**: Implementing transparent overlay window system for screen-wide annotations. This creates the foundation for all drawing and annotation features that will be built in subsequent checkpoints.

**Success Criteria for Checkpoint 1.3**:
- OverlayWindow class with transparent, borderless configuration
- Window displays on all Spaces and stays on top of other applications
- OverlayContentView handles mouse events for future drawing functionality
- Window can be shown/hidden programmatically
- Proper integration with existing AppDelegate and screen capture system
