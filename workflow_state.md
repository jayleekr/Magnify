## Embedded Rules

### RULE_CHECKPOINT_01: Project Foundation
- All basic project files must be created and properly configured
- Bundle ID, entitlements, and Info.plist must be App Store ready
- Code must follow Swift and AppKit best practices
- Project structure must support future feature additions

### RULE_CHECKPOINT_02: Screen Capture Core
- Must use ScreenCaptureKit for macOS 12.3+ compatibility
- Proper permission handling and user guidance required
- Display detection and selection functionality needed
- Error handling for permission denied scenarios

## Active Plan

**Current Focus**: Implementing settings and preferences system with SwiftUI interface for user customization. This creates a professional configuration experience allowing users to customize hotkeys, drawing tools, and app behavior.

**Success Criteria for Checkpoint 1.5**:
- PreferencesManager class with persistent configuration storage
- SwiftUI preferences window with tabbed interface
- Hotkey customization with conflict detection
- Drawing tool preferences (colors, stroke width, opacity)
- App behavior settings (startup, overlay behavior, performance)
- Integration with existing HotkeyManager and OverlayWindow systems
