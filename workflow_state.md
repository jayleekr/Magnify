## Embedded Rules

### RULE_CHECKPOINT_01: Project Foundation
- All basic project files must be created and properly configured
- Bundle ID, entitlements, and Info.plist must be App Store ready
- Code must follow Swift and AppKit best practices
- Project structure must support future feature additions

### RULE_CHECKPOINT_02: Screen Capture Core
- Must use ScreenCaptureKit for macOS 12.3+ compatibility
- Proper permission handling and user guidance required
- Display detection and selection functionality needed
- Error handling for permission denied scenarios

### RULE_CHECKPOINT_03: Preferences Integration
- All user preferences must be persistent via UserDefaults
- SwiftUI preferences interface must integrate seamlessly with AppKit
- Settings must be validated and provide appropriate defaults
- Import/export functionality required for user configuration backup

### RULE_MILESTONE_02: Zoom & Annotation Features
- All zoom functionality must maintain 60fps performance with GPU acceleration
- Magnification must support 1x to 10x range with smooth transitions
- Real-time content updates required with <50ms response time
- Mouse tracking must be pixel-perfect in zoom window
- All drawing tools must integrate seamlessly with zoom functionality
- Annotation system must support undo/redo with complete state management
- File export must support multiple formats (PNG, PDF, SVG)

### RULE_PR_WORKFLOW_01: Mandatory Pull Request Process
**CRITICAL WORKFLOW VIOLATION PREVENTION**
- **NEVER commit directly to main branch** - All implementation must go through feature branches
- **Checkpoint Implementation Process:**
  1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/checkpoint-X-Y-description`
  2. Implement changes with progressive commits
  3. Push branch: `git push origin feature/checkpoint-X-Y-description`
  4. Create PR: `./.github/scripts/create-checkpoint-pr.sh X.Y "Title" "Description"`
  5. Merge PR after review
- **Exception**: Only README updates and documentation fixes allowed on main
- **Enforcement**: This rule must be followed for all future checkpoints
- **Note**: Checkpoint 3.1 was incorrectly committed directly to main - this workflow violation must not be repeated

### RULE_GITHUB_CLI_01: GitHub CLI Setup Required
- GitHub CLI must be authenticated before any PR creation
- Use SSH authentication method: `gh auth login --git-protocol ssh --web`
- Test authentication: `gh auth status` must show successful login
- Automation scripts require GitHub CLI to function properly
